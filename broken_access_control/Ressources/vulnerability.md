# BROKEN ACCESS CONTROL

## Explanation

Thereâ€™s a cookie which value is MD5 hash of `false` (`68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327`)

We have to replace it by the MD5 hash of `true` (`b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09`) to get the flag

## Exploitation

**This vulnerability ranks number 5 in OWASP's top 10 Web Application Security Risk**

Metadata manipulation, such as :
  - replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT) access control token
  - tampering with a cookie
  - manipulate a hidden field to elevate privileges
  - abusing JWT invalidation.

This vulnerability is for the user to modify something somewhere manually to bypass access control.

## Prevention

> _Access control is only effective if enforced in trusted server-side code or server-less API, where the attacker cannot modify the access control check or metadata._
  - _Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata (e.g. .git) and backup files are not present within web roots._
  - _JWT tokens should be invalidated on the server after logout._
  - _With the exception of public resources, deny by default._
