# REFERER / USER AGENT TAMPERING

## Explanation

When we inspect the source code of the website credentials page, we see the following comments :

- Let's use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot.

By changing both the user-agent header and the referer with curl, we get the flag

## Exploitation / Prevention

I don't see any real life use case of this.
It had the pedagogical purpose to make us discover referer and user-agent.
